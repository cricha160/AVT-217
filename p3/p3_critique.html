<h1>5 Good Portfolio Websites</h1>
	
<h2>1. <a href="Victor.work">Victor.work</a></h2>
<h3>The homepage of this website is pretty cool because it catches my attention right away. You have to look around for the other navigation on the webpage but overall I like the way this one looks. I love the addition of the circle when you hover over the navigation options.</h3>
<br>

<h2>2. <a href="rickymichiels.com">Rickymichiels.com</a></h2>
<h3>I like the homepage the best because it has a bunch of images displayed right when you click on it. The final photograph that stays on the homepage is pretty representational of his work. I think getting to see a sample of his work is great and gives you an immediate impression of that artist and what his style is immediately. This is definitely something I'd like to incorporate in my website somehow.</h3>

<h2>3. <a href="lusion.co">lusion.co</a></h2>
<h3>I love this webpage! I love the simplistic copy above the fold. The way the background is moving around is amazing and I love the hovering mouse. The colors are so aesthetically pleasing, I could look at this all day. All I have to do is scroll to see everything I need to. The images are absolutely captivating.</h3>

<h2>4. <a href="vincentsaisset.com">vincentsaisset.com</a></h2>
<h3>I love that simplistic typeface. It's bold and beautiful. I love how you can see more as you scroll. This is one of my favorites based off of the simple but effective design.</h3>

<h2>5. <a href="christammar.com/projects">christammar.com/projects</a></h2>
<h3>I think this website is effective, but I also wish it had a homepage that wasn't just about the projects. I like that it gets to the point and you get to see his work as soon as possible but I wish it had more to it than that. I like how the projects are listed but it really just needs a homepage that isn't the projects section.</h3>
