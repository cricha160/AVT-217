				<h1>Hi, I'm Charity!</h1>
				<p>	I am from a small town near Roanoke, VA and I love drawing!</p>
		<p>I'm currently a senior at George Mason, studying Art and Visual Technology. My concentration is in Drawing, but I have a variety of experience in anything from Graphic Design to Printmaking.
		I love experimenting and trying anything new!</p>
		
		<p>I hope to own my own business someday so in the mean time I am doing content marketing. I do anything from managing social media to email lists and ad campaigns!</p>
